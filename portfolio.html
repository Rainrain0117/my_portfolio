                This is my very first project created while I am still in the University and learning about web development from scratch.
                It is a project that showcases the learning we've acquired for a couple of semesters. This E-commerce website contains books
                and reading materials to follow the theme of online shops. It uses HTML, CSS and PHP for database integration. It was previously hosted
                online but due to monthly subscriptions it was only hosted for the trial period. (Note: Databases are not uploaded due to LMS complications)

                This is a collaborative project made with seniors on my university to come up with a project
                to showcase our own skills taught in each respective semesters, we were assigned for the front-end 
                design of the project whereas they embed a system on how to keep track and record each event implemented
                in their built calendar within the program. This enhanced our HTML and CSS integration to a new level.
