            <div class="about">ABOUT ME</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am Majed. My full name is Jan Majed Shahata. I am currently residing Poblacion B, Rosario, Batangas
                I was born on the 17th of January in the year 2001. I finished a 4-year IT course at University of Batangas
                in Lipa. I was an irregular student when I was still studying because I shifted from the accounting course hoping
                that may passion for computers would bear fruit; and that the pandemic will not affect the IT course so much that it
                could be learnt from home. I am currently in search for a firm that would welcome a newcomer of the corporate world
                and help me grow not only as an employee but also as an individual. <br>
            </div>

            <div class="about" id="about-2">WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
                <div class="content">
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I worked for Limcoma Rosario as a Bank Assistant that helped in Asset and Liability
                    operations for the staff using excel, it provided me with basic accounting knowledge and
                    basic excel skills that can come in handy for handling data in databases. I would say that
                    this is handy for entering collective data.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At my college OJT, I worked for Kaizenaire Inc, an all-rounder company that trains their
                    interns for content creation and SEO in a form of creating wordpress blogs to promote items for their
                    clients. I could say that I learned how to create prompts that I can use for problem-solving and
                    promotion for a better UX (user experience) and satisfaction.
